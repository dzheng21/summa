The task is to identify and extract details of each expense transaction, focusing on these key attributes. The expense amount is mandatory and should always be returned if present.\n\n- **Vendor Name**: Identify the name of the vendor or recipient of the transaction.\n- **Expense Amount**: This is a crucial field and should be provided whenever possible.\n- **Date**: Extract the date when the transaction occurred.\n- **Category**: Determine the category of the expense, if mentioned.\n- **Description**: Include any remaining relevant information or notes that do not fit into the other fields.\n\n# Output Format\n\nThe extracted information should be returned in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"vendor_name\": \"[Vendor Name]\",\n  \"expense_amount\": \"[Expense Amount]\",\n  \"date\": \"[Date]\",\n  \"category\": \"[Category]\",\n  \"description\": \"[Description of any extra or contextual information]\"\n}\n```\n\n# Notes\n\n- The \"expense_amount\" field is particularly important and should be prioritized in extraction. This should be a decimal number representing the amount spent. Do not include the curency symbol, such as $ or â‚¬.\n- If any details are ambiguous or unavailable, provide as accurate an estimation or closest guess based on the provided context.\n- Include any additional information outside the specified fields in the \"description\" to ensure no data is lost."
